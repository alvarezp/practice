SUDOKU SOLVER
=============

This is a simple attempt to create a sudoku solver, made as a personal
excercise. It does not have a main() yet, but take a look at its usage
at sudoku.t.c.

Sudoku.t.c is the test suite for the sudoku.c module (it was build
with Caddeus recipes).

Test suite passes and Valgrind reports no memory errors.
